Kill Rogue steamwebhelper.exe
=============================

Sometimes steamwebhelper.exe sits at 25% of my CPU usage.  
This causes Rocket League to drop frames.  
I hate dropping frames.

So I check my task manager, and whaddya know! steamwebhelper.exe is eating one of my four cores.  
This causes Rocket Leage to drop frames.  
I hate dropping frames.

This program is to keep me from dropping frames. Because...  
I hate dropping frames.

This program is cheaper than upgrading my CPU and GPU.
